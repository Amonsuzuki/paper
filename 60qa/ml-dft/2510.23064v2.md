# 60QA Analysis: LightPFP: A Lightweight Route to Ab Initio Accuracy at Scale

## １．はじめに・序論 / Introduction

### 1-1. 本研究の社会的背景は何か？ / What is the social background?

**回答：**

The development of accurate and computationally efficient atomistic energy methods is critical for enabling large-scale atomistic simulations in materials science, catalysis, and chemistry. These simulations are essential for advancing materials discovery, understanding chemical processes, and designing new functional materials for applications such as batteries, catalysts, and advanced materials systems.

### 1-2. 本研究のtarget task/problemは何か？ / What is the target problem of this work?

**回答：**

The target problem is to develop task-specific machine learning interatomic potentials (ts-MLIPs) that achieve both computational efficiency for large-scale simulations and high accuracy comparable to first-principles methods, while avoiding the prohibitively expensive DFT data generation required by conventional ts-MLIP training approaches.

### 1-3. 本研究のtarget problemの具体例（ユースケース）は何か？ / Explain a typical use case.

**回答：**

Typical use cases include: (1) simulating Li⁺ diffusion in solid electrolytes like Li₆PS₅Cl for solid-state battery development, (2) analyzing mechanical and grain-boundary properties of high-entropy alloys such as AlCoCrFeNi, (3) modeling reaction kinetics in reactive systems like SiO₂ etching by HF vapor, and (4) predicting thermodynamic properties such as the melting point of MgO.

### 1-4. そのtarget problemが難しいと言う根拠は何か？既存手法が誤る例はどんなケースか？ / Why is this task challenging?

**回答：**

This task is challenging because it requires balancing three competing factors: computational efficiency, accuracy, and training cost. Universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability but have computational overhead limiting large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs achieve superior efficiency but require weeks or months of expensive DFT calculations for each new material system. Existing methods face bottlenecks either in inference speed (u-MLIPs) or in prohibitive training costs (ts-MLIPs trained on DFT data).

### 1-5. 既存手法はなぜ不十分なのか？ / Why are conventional studies insufficient?

**回答：**

Conventional universal MLIPs like PFP, M3GNet, CHGNet, and MACE-MP-0 have computational overhead that limits large-scale simulations, typically handling only ~10⁴ atoms. Task-specific MLIPs with simpler architectures (MTP, DeePMD, Allegro) can achieve better speed but still "feed" directly on DFT data, requiring extensive DFT calculations that take weeks or months for each new material system. This severely limits their practical deployment despite superior inference speed.

### 1-6. 本研究では何を提案し、何を解決するのか？ / What is proposed and solved in this study?

**回答：**

This study proposes LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework that generates task-specific MLIPs by leveraging universal MLIPs to generate high-quality training data instead of using costly DFT calculations. LightPFP solves the training bottleneck by enabling three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions and achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs.

### 1-7. 提案手法は既存手法と何が違うのか？主要な違いに絞って述べよ。 / What is the difference between the proposed and conventional methods?

**回答：**

The main differences are: (1) LightPFP uses a universal MLIP (PFP) as the teacher to generate training data instead of DFT, dramatically reducing data collection time from ~8000 hours to ~3.5 hours; (2) it utilizes pre-trained lightweight MLIP models (MTP architecture) initialized with meta-learning (Reptile algorithm), significantly enhancing data efficiency; (3) it does not require teacher model fine-tuning for each new application.

### 1-8. 既存手法との違う部分は、なぜ導入するべきなのか？なぜ導入するとうまくいくと予想されるのか？ / Explain why the difference should be introduced.

**回答：**

These differences should be introduced because they address the fundamental bottleneck of ts-MLIP training cost while maintaining accuracy. Using u-MLIP for data generation works because modern u-MLIPs like PFP already achieve high accuracy (~10 meV/atom error compared to DFT). Pre-training with meta-learning enables the student model to learn generalizable representations across diverse materials, requiring only fine-tuning on small datasets (100 structures can match 1529-structure performance). This approach is expected to work because it leverages the already-invested computational cost in training the u-MLIP.

### 1-9. 提案手法の新規性は何か？箇条書きせよ。 / What is the novelty of the proposed method?

**回答：**

- Knowledge distillation from universal MLIP to task-specific MLIP, avoiding expensive DFT data generation
- Pre-trained student models using Reptile meta-learning algorithm on diverse datasets for enhanced data efficiency
- Demonstration of u-MLIP-driven distillation achieving ~100x faster training than DFT-based approaches
- Framework enabling precision transfer learning with as few as 10 DFT data points to correct systematic u-MLIP errors
- Comprehensive validation across diverse materials systems (solid electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, reactive systems)

### 1-10. 提案手法全体の構成をeye-catch figureを用いて示せ（通常6回修正ののち確定）。 / Show the eye-catch figure.

**回答：**

Figure 2 in the paper shows the schematic diagram of LightPFP framework: (1) Target structure input, (2) Pre-trained teacher (PFP) and pre-trained student (MTP) initialized from large diverse DFT dataset, (3) Training data generation using PFP, (4) Task-specific parameter extraction, (5) Student fine-tuning, (6) Evaluation using PFP. The figure also shows the "food chain" concept (Figure 1) positioning LightPFP as extending the computational efficiency hierarchy: Formally exact methods → DFT → u-MLIP → u-MLIP distillation (LightPFP).

The PFP training database is noted for its high complexity and diversity, contributing to superior robustness.

### 2-5. 提案手法と類似手法A（＋類似手法B、類似手法C）との違いは何か？ / What is the difference(s) between the proposed and related methods?

**回答：**

Compared to existing distillation approaches (Morrow et al., Amin et al., Gardner et al., Zhang et al.): LightPFP uniquely combines (1) teacher trained from diverse datasets, (2) teacher usage in data generation, (3) active learning with teacher's labels, (4) student pretraining, and (5) no requirement for teacher fine-tuning. Most prior works lack student pretraining and require teacher fine-tuning, making them less efficient.

## ４．手法 / Method

### 4-1. 本研究は何の手法を拡張した何を提案するものか？ / Which method do you extend?

**回答：**

This study extends knowledge distillation methodology by proposing LightPFP, which distills the universal MLIP PFP (based on TeaNet architecture) into task-specific MLIPs using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) architecture, with the innovation of incorporating pre-trained student models via meta-learning.

**回答：**

The LightPFP framework is generally applicable to any combination of universal MLIP teachers and task-specific student architectures. The distillation approach does not depend on specific architectural details of PFP or MTP, and could work with other u-MLIPs (M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE) as teachers and other efficient architectures (DeePMD, Allegro) as students. The meta-learning pre-training strategy is architecture-agnostic and could benefit any parametric MLIP model.

### 4-3. 提案手法と既存手法の違いを箇条書きせよ。 / List the differences between the proposed method and the conventional methods.

**回答：**

Figure 2 shows the structure: The framework begins with a target structure, which feeds into both pre-trained models (teacher PFP and student MTP, both initialized from large DFT datasets). The teacher generates training data through sampling and labeling. Task-specific parameters are extracted by removing unnecessary element pairs. The student is fine-tuned on teacher-generated data, then evaluated against teacher predictions.

### 4-6. 入力を数式（またはx等の記号）で定義し説明せよ。各入力はそれぞれ何次元か？ / Define the input to the proposed method.

**回答：**

The input is an atomic configuration represented by atomic positions {rᵢ} where i=1...N for N atoms, lattice vectors (cell parameters), and atomic species {Zᵢ}. For MTP architecture, the input is transformed into moment tensor descriptors that encode local atomic environments up to specified radial cutoff and angular orders. The teacher model PFP takes similar atomic configuration inputs and produces energy E, forces {Fᵢ}, and stress tensor σ as outputs.

**回答：**

For the MTP student model, input features are extracted through moment tensor descriptors that capture local atomic environments using polynomial combinations of neighbor atom positions. These descriptors are rotationally and translationally invariant. The teacher model PFP uses the TeaNet architecture which employs graph neural networks with message passing to extract features encoding atomic interactions while respecting physical symmetries.

Role is to generate accurate energy, force, and stress predictions for sampled configurations. Input: atomic configurations from target material. Output: energies, forces, stresses with accuracy ~10 meV/atom compared to DFT. Structure: TeaNet-based graph neural network trained on diverse DFT database covering ~118 elements and various bonding environments.

### 4-9. N個目のモジュールのmotivation・役割・入出力・構造を示して説明せよ。 / Explain the N-th module.

**回答：**

**Pre-trained Student Module (MTP):** Motivation is to achieve fast inference while leveraging prior knowledge from diverse materials. Role is to provide data-efficient initialization for task-specific fine-tuning. Input: moment tensor descriptors of atomic configurations. Output: predicted energies, forces, stresses. Structure: MTP architecture with pre-trained parameters via Reptile meta-learning algorithm on diverse datasets, enabling fine-tuning with as few as 100 structures to achieve performance matching 1529-structure training from scratch.

### 4-10. 予測を数式で定義せよ。 / Define the prediction.

**回答：**

For the MTP student model, the total energy is predicted as E = Σᵢ Eᵢ where Eᵢ is the atomic energy of atom i expressed as a linear combination of moment tensor basis functions: Eᵢ = Σₐ cₐ Mₐ(ρᵢ), where cₐ are learnable coefficients, Mₐ are moment tensor basis functions, and ρᵢ represents the local atomic environment. Forces are computed as Fᵢ = -∂E/∂rᵢ and stress as σ = -(1/V)∂E/∂ε where V is volume and ε is strain.

### 4-11. 損失関数の定義を示せ。 / What is the loss function?

**回答：**

The loss function is a weighted combination of energy, force, and stress errors: L = wₑ·Σ(Eᵖʳᵉᵈ - Eᵗᵉᵃᶜʰᵉʳ)² + wf·Σᵢ||Fᵢᵖʳᵉᵈ - Fᵢᵗᵉᵃᶜʰᵉʳ||² + wₛ·Σ||σᵖʳᵉᵈ - σᵗᵉᵃᶜʰᵉʳ||², where wₑ, wf, wₛ are weighting coefficients, and the teacher labels come from PFP predictions rather than DFT. For precision transfer learning, a small number of DFT labels can replace teacher labels: Lᵗʳᵃⁿˢᶠᵉʳ = wₑ·Σ(Eᵖʳᵉᵈ - Eᴰᶠᵀ)² + wf·Σᵢ||Fᵢᵖʳᵉᵈ - Fᵢᴰᶠᵀ||².

**回答：**

Multiple task-specific datasets were constructed for different material systems: (1) Li₆PS₅Cl: 1780 structures (387,300 atoms total) labeled by PFP, including NPT MD at 300-1500K, rattle (random atomic displacements), lattice compression/stretching, deformations, and vacancy structures. (2) Ni₃Al: 1529 structures with comprehensive sampling. (3) AlCoCrFeNi HEA: structures for bulk and grain boundary systems. (4) SiO₂/HF: reactive system structures. All datasets use PFP for labeling except comparison MTP-DFT which uses DFT labels.

### 5-2. データセットのアノテーション方法（アノテータへ何を指示したか）を示せ。 / Explain about the annotation method.

**回答：**

Annotation is performed automatically by the PFP teacher model (or DFT for comparison). The process involves: (1) sampling configurations through MD simulations (NPT ensemble at various temperatures, 1 sample per 100 steps), (2) static perturbations (random atomic displacements, lattice compression/stretching, deformations), (3) defect structures (vacancies), and (4) running single-point calculations with PFP to obtain energy, force, and stress labels for each configuration.

### 5-3. なぜ標準データセットを使わなかったのか？使ったのであれば、なぜ使ったのか？ / Why did not you use the standard dataset?

**回答：**

Standard datasets were not directly applicable because: (1) the goal is to demonstrate efficient generation of task-specific datasets for arbitrary material systems, (2) existing DFT datasets would defeat the purpose of avoiding expensive DFT calculations, and (3) each application requires specific configuration space sampling relevant to the target properties (e.g., high-temperature MD for diffusion, grain boundaries for HEA, reactive configurations for etching). The pre-trained models do use diverse standard datasets (from PFP training) for initialization via meta-learning.

### 5-4. データセットをどのように事前処理（またはデータ拡張）したか？ / How was the dataset pre-processed?

**回答：**

Data preprocessing and augmentation include: (1) Structure relaxation: equilibrating initial configurations before MD sampling, (2) Temperature sampling: NPT MD at multiple temperatures (300K, 500K, 1000K, 1500K) to cover relevant thermal fluctuations, (3) Lattice perturbations: systematic compression, stretching, and deformation to sample strain states, (4) Atomic displacements: random rattle to explore local potential energy surface, (5) Defect generation: creating vacancy structures (1-2 vacancies) to sample defective configurations.

### 5-5. データセットの統計情報を示せ。 / Explain about the statistics of the dataset.

**回答：**

For Li₆PS₅Cl LightPFP dataset: 1780 structures, 387,300 total atoms, composition: 1600 MD structures, 10 rattle, 22 compress, 48 deform, 100 vacancy. For Li₆PS₅Cl MTP-DFT dataset: 980 structures, 50,860 total atoms (smaller due to DFT computational constraints), composition: 800 MD, 10 rattle, 22 compress, 48 deform, 100 vacancy.

### 5-6. training set・validation set・test setをどのように分割したか？各々のサイズを示せ。 / How was the dataset divided?

**回答：**

For data efficiency studies (Ni₃Al): datasets of varying sizes (100, 250, 400, 550, 700, 850, 1529 structures) were created through two methods - subsampling from full dataset and direct sampling via decreased MD steps. Each size created 5 times for uncertainty estimation. For MTP-DFT comparison: 10% held-out test split from 980 structures. Validation is performed through application-specific metrics rather than standard train/val/test splits.

### 5-7. training set・validation set・test setを各々どのように使用したか？ / How was each set used?

**回答：**

Training set: used for fine-tuning pre-trained student models via optimization of energy/force/stress loss. Validation: performed through comparison with teacher model (PFP) predictions on configurations not in training set. Testing: evaluated through application-specific tasks including phonon spectra, surface energies, diffusion coefficients, elastic constants, grain boundary energies, and melting points. For MTP-DFT, 10% test split used for force MAE parity plots.

### 5-8. 提案手法の設定（最適化手法、エポック数、ハイパーパラメータ等）を表にまとめよ。 / Show experimental setup table.

**回答：**

For MTP student models: Level_max parameter controls angular complexity, radial basis functions determine interaction range, cutoff radius ~5-6Å typically. Training: ~1 hour on single GPU. Optimizer details and specific hyperparameters follow MTP standard implementation. Pre-training: Reptile meta-learning algorithm on diverse datasets. For teacher model (PFP v7.0.0): standard inference settings, no fine-tuning required. Data generation: 3.5 hours for Li₆PS₅Cl on single GPU including MD sampling (100-step intervals) and structure perturbations.

### 5-9. 提案手法のパラメータ数と積和演算数を示せ。 / How many parameters and multiply-add operations?

**回答：**

The MTP student models have significantly fewer parameters than u-MLIP teachers, enabling faster inference. The paper reports that LightPFP/MTP-DFT achieve inference speed of 9.7×10⁻⁷ s/step/atom, approximately 50× faster than PFP (4.9×10⁻⁵ s/step/atom) and 160× faster than MACE (1.6×10⁻⁴ s/step/atom). Exact parameter counts depend on level_max and element pairs included. Pre-trained models can be reduced by removing parameters for unused element pairs.

### 5-10. 訓練に用いたハードウェア構成を示せ。 / Explain about the hardware spec.

**回答：**

Training and evaluation performed on NVIDIA V100 GPUs with 16 GB GPU memory. Data generation for Li₆PS₅Cl: 3.5 hours on single GPU. Model training: ~1 hour on single GPU.

### 5-11. 訓練に要した時間を示せ。また、１サンプルあたりの推論に要した時間を示せ。 / Training time and inference time per sample?

**回答：**

For Li₆PS₅Cl: Total LightPFP construction time 4.5 hours (3.5 hours data generation + 1 hour training) vs MTP-DFT ~101 hours (100 hours data generation + 1 hour training), and estimated ~8000 hours for fully DFT-driven MD. Inference speed: LightPFP/MTP-DFT: 9.7×10⁻⁷ s/step/atom; PFP: 4.9×10⁻⁵ s/step/atom; MACE: 1.6×10⁻⁴ s/step/atom. For 10ns simulation of 10,000-atom system: LightPFP fastest, completing 44-139× faster than u-MLIPs.

## ６．実験結果 / Experimental Results

### 6-1. ベースライン手法との定量的比較結果を示せ。 / Show quantitative comparison results.

**回答：**

Li⁺ diffusion activation energy: DFT reference: 0.52 eV, PFP: 0.45±0.04 eV, LightPFP: 0.50±0.04 eV, MACE: 0.37±0.04 eV, MTP-DFT: 0.47±0.04 eV. Inference speed ratio (vs LightPFP): PFP: ~50×slower, MACE: ~160×slower. Model construction time ratio: MTP-DFT: ~20×slower, estimated DFT-MD: ~1800×slower.

### 6-2. 何をベースライン手法（群）としたか？ / What baseline methods were used?

**回答：**

Four baseline/comparison methods: (1) PFP v7.0.0 (u-MLIP teacher), (2) MACE-MP-0b3 (alternative u-MLIP), (3) MTP-DFT (task-specific MTP trained on DFT labels, same architecture as LightPFP), and (4) ab initio DFT MD results from literature where available. These represent: direct u-MLIP usage, alternative u-MLIP, traditional DFT-based ts-MLIP training, and ground truth reference respectively.

### 6-3. 上記ベースラインを選んだ理由を説明せよ。 / Explain the reason for choosing these baselines.

**回答：**

PFP chosen as primary teacher and comparison because it's the u-MLIP being distilled and represents state-of-art broad transferability. MACE chosen as alternative u-MLIP to demonstrate teacher quality matters. MTP-DFT chosen as critical comparison to isolate the effect of using u-MLIP vs DFT for training data - same student architecture and training procedure, only label source differs. DFT reference validates absolute accuracy. Together, these baselines enable comprehensive assessment of speed/accuracy/cost trade-offs.

### 6-4. 評価尺度（群）について数式で説明せよ。複数あるのであれば、どれが主要尺度か？ / Explain the metrics with equations.

**回答：**

Force MAE: MAE_F = (1/N_atoms)Σᵢ||Fᵢᵖʳᵉᵈ - Fᵢʳᵉᶠ|| where N_atoms is total atoms across test structures. Li⁺ diffusion coefficient from Einstein relation: D = lim_{t→∞}⟨|r(t)-r(0)|²⟩/6t where averaging over Li atoms and trajectories. Activation energy: Eₐ from Arrhenius fit D=D₀exp(-Eₐ/kT). Inference speed: seconds per MD step per atom. Primary metrics are force MAE for accuracy, application-specific properties for reliability (diffusion, phonon, etc.), and total time cost combining construction and simulation.

### 6-5. なぜそれらの評価尺度を使用したのか？他の評価尺度ではダメなのか？ / Why use these metrics?

**回答：**

Force MAE chosen because forces are critical for MD accuracy and more sensitive than energy. Application-specific metrics (diffusion coefficients, phonon spectra, surface energies, elastic constants, melting points) chosen because they represent real-world use cases and reveal whether small force errors propagate to property prediction failures. Computational metrics (speed, memory, construction time) essential for assessing practical deployability. Energy MAE alone insufficient as small force errors can accumulate over long MD trajectories. These comprehensive metrics validate both pointwise accuracy and downstream reliability.

### 6-6. ベースラインと提案手法の性能を絶対的な値で示せ。 / Show performance in absolute values.

**回答：**

Li₆PS₅Cl force MAE (eV/Å): PFP=0.028, LightPFP=0.053, MACE=0.061, MTP-DFT=0.044. Diffusion activation energy Eₐ (eV): DFT=0.52, PFP=0.45±0.04, LightPFP=0.50±0.04, MACE=0.37±0.04, MTP-DFT=0.47±0.04. Diffusion coefficient at 800K (cm²/s): DFT~3×10⁻⁶, PFP~6×10⁻⁶, LightPFP~5×10⁻⁶, MACE~10×10⁻⁶, MTP-DFT~6×10⁻⁶. AlCoCrFeNi surface energy (J/m²): DFT=1.86±0.05, PFP=1.84±0.02, LightPFP=1.87±0.03. Elastic constants show similar good agreement across methods.

### 6-7. 実験結果は統計的に有意（p<0.05）であったか？ / Were results statistically significant?

**回答：**

Statistical significance established through multiple independent replicas: 8 independent trajectories for Li⁺ diffusion at each temperature, error bars derived from standard error of fitted slopes. For Ni₃Al data efficiency study, 5 independent datasets per size for uncertainty quantification. AlCoCrFeNi calculations use 10 independent runs for surface and grain boundary energies. MgO melting point determined from multiple heating/cooling cycles. Error bars in figures indicate standard errors confirming statistically meaningful differences.

### 6-8. 定性的結果：提案手法が成功した例を示せ。 / Qualitative results: successful cases.

LightPFP successfully predicted: (1) Ni₃Al phonon spectra matching full-dataset training using only 100 structures, while scratch-trained models showed large deviations; (2) AlCoCrFeNi surface energies (1.87±0.03 J/m²) agreeing with DFT (1.86±0.05 J/m²) and PFP (1.84±0.02 J/m²) within error bars; (3) Li₆PS₅Cl diffusion activation energy (0.50±0.04 eV) closer to DFT reference (0.52 eV) than MACE (0.37±0.04 eV) despite MACE being more complex u-MLIP; (4) achieving 44-139× total time reduction vs u-MLIPs for 10ns simulation of 10,000-atom system.

### 6-9. 定性的結果：提案手法が失敗した例を示せ。なぜ失敗したのか？ / Qualitative results: failure cases.

**回答：**

LightPFP shows limitations in: (1) MgO melting point prediction where PFP underestimates by ~400K due to systematic errors in teacher model - this is inherited by student; (2) force MAE (0.053 eV/Å) higher than PFP (0.028 eV/Å) due to reduced model capacity and knowledge distillation imperfection; (3) slight overestimation of Li⁺ diffusion compared to DFT, propagating teacher's deviation. Failures occur when teacher model has systematic errors or when student model capacity insufficient to capture all complexity. These are addressable through precision transfer learning with small DFT datasets.

### 6-10. Ablation studyにおいて何のために何を取り除いたかを説明せよ。 / Explain ablation study.

**回答：**

Data efficiency ablation: compared pre-trained vs scratch-trained student models across dataset sizes (100-1529 structures for Ni₃Al). Ablating pre-training shows: (1) fine-tuned pre-trained models consistently outperform scratch-trained; (2) pre-trained with 100 structures matches scratch-trained with 1529 structures; (3) scratch-trained shows overfitting - low force error on small datasets but poor phonon/surface energy predictions; (4) pre-trained maintains robust application performance across all dataset sizes. This validates pre-training via meta-learning as critical component.

### 6-11. 混同行列を示せ。 / Show confusion matrix.

**回答：**

Not applicable. This is a regression task (predicting continuous energy/force values) rather than classification, so confusion matrix is not relevant. Instead, parity plots (Figure 5) show predicted vs reference forces, and property comparisons (diffusion, phonon spectra, etc.) validate performance across different output types.

### 6-12. 提案手法の失敗例は予測結果の中に合計何サンプルあったか？ / How many failure cases?

**回答：**

Quantitative failures measured by MAE across all test samples rather than binary success/failure. For Li₆PS₅Cl, the force MAE of 0.053 eV/Å represents average deviation across all atoms in test structures. The distribution in parity plots shows most predictions within ~0.1 eV/Å of reference, with tail of larger errors. For application properties, most show good agreement except systematic cases like MgO melting point where teacher model has inherent bias.

### 6-13. 失敗例を人手でカテゴリに分類せよ。各カテゴリの定義を示せ。 / Classify failure cases into categories.

**回答：**

Failure categories: (1) Inherited teacher errors - systematic biases from u-MLIP propagate to student (e.g., MgO melting point underestimation); (2) Distillation imperfection - student force MAE slightly higher than teacher despite training on teacher labels, due to reduced model capacity; (3) Configuration extrapolation - rare configurations far from training distribution show larger errors; (4) Property-specific deviations - phonon frequencies or diffusion coefficients may deviate even when force MAE is low, indicating accumulated errors in dynamic properties. Category (1) addressable via transfer learning; (2)-(4) addressable via expanded sampling or larger student models.

### 6-14. 失敗の主要な要因とpossible solutionについて説明せよ。 / Explain main bottleneck and possible solution.

**回答：**

Main bottleneck: inheriting systematic errors from teacher u-MLIP when teacher's accuracy is insufficient for target application. Demonstrated solution: precision transfer learning using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points. For MgO, this corrected ~400K melting point underestimation, improving prediction from 2476K to 3054K (reference 3125K). Secondary bottleneck: reduced student model capacity. Possible solutions: (1) use larger MTP hyperparameters (higher level_max, more radial functions), (2) alternative student architectures with better accuracy/efficiency trade-offs, (3) ensemble methods combining multiple students.
